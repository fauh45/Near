# Near

Near is a connected IoT project for couples, friends, and more. It's an exploration on how a simple device could connect people together.

## v1 (MOOD LIGHT)

Version 1 of the Near project is pretty simple, an interconnected small RGB LED mood light device that can trigger the other mood light.
The idea currently is to be simply put on a desk or places where people spend their day most of the time, thus they can receive a simple
notification through the light from other people in the interconnected network of the device.

An exploration of usage of this device could also lead for it to be able to be triggered from external event, or some kind of time-based
event that's important to one or all the device in the interconnected network of it. The concept stays simple, while each other might not
be there, the notification, or "nag" that they receive hopefully make them feel more together.

### Technicality

It's a super simple device. Consisting of ESP32-C3 Super Mini as the MCU, a button, 4 addressable RGB, and 2 capacitors. All of it are mounted on
a small (25 x 28mm) PCB board. All of it mounted on a SMD mounting.

### Timeline

- 27 November 2024, finalized the design, and start the PCB and parts order
