        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>
          The fact that you can open this page, that means you're one proud
          owner of the <mark>Near v1 Light Device<sup>¬©</sup></mark
          >. Congratulations for your ownership! This page will guide you on how
          to get your device setup and running. So you'll connect to other user
          of the device as well!
        </p>

        <p>
          Well that's quite the introduction. The only owner of this device is
          really just me, and you,
          <mark>my lovely sweety 500/10 cutie</mark> which I totally adore.
          Anyway here's the steps to get your device working, and can nag your
          boyfie in no time at all!
        </p>

          For the device setup, I suggest for you to use Chrome browser on
          Windows or Android and <b>not in any Apple device</b>. Because Apple
          doesn't feel like implementing this feature, and will never be until
          they can "profit" out of it.

        <h2>Flashing firmware to your device</h2>
        <p>
          This is one crucial part of the device setup. The hardware without any
          smarts (the software you're about to flash) is just a brainless
          expensive plastic, silicone, tin, and glass! Now what you need to do
          is the following.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h3>Get your device connected</h3>
          <p>
            Now search for a nearby <mark>type-c cable</mark>, now make sure
            that your cable is data cable (one that can transfer data), not just
            a power cable. Most cable should work though!
          </p>

          <p>
            Now plug the cable to the device! It should <mark>glow red</mark> to
            indicate that it got power!
          </p>

          <h3>Flash time baby üòé</h3>
          <p>
            Now that your device is connected, all you need to do is push the
            button (<mark>labelled "Connect"</mark>) below. When you do it will
            ask you for several things. <b>Don't panic!</b>, you just need to
            follow these steps.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Click for the device that <mark>have "USB" in its name</mark>.
              Usually that's the right one. If you're not sure
              <i>call me, baby</i> üòé.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then all you need to do is click
              <mark>Install Near v1 Firmware</mark>, and wait for it to do its
              <i>magical üßöü™Ñ</i> stuff.
            </li>
            <li>
              That's all you're all set for the flashing portion! You're now a
              certified <b>HnF Engineering‚ù§Ô∏è Technician</b>.

          Now that your device has been flashed. Time connect to the mothership
          and make it able to talk to eachother!

        <h2>Known Issue</h2>

        <h4>Version <code>2025.03.10</code></h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            LED color is off, and the "dance" is not nicely coreographed. Seems
            like because of the RMT timing got interrupted by STA WiFi and
            probably the BLE.
            <i
              >Possibly could be resolved by using Improv Serial instead of
              Improv BLE.</i
